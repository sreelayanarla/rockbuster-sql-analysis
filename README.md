# rockbuster-sql-analysis
SQL-based data analysis project for Rockbuster Stealth LLC. Includes exploratory and strategic queries to support the company's transition from physical rentals to an online video streaming model. Visualizations created in Tableau are based on business insights such as customer demographics, revenue drivers, and geographic trends.
Rockbuster Stealth SQL Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project was developed as part of CareerFoundryâ€™s Data Analytics Program (Achievement 3). Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company, is preparing to launch an online video rental platform to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime. The management team needs data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions for this transition.

As a data analyst on the project, I used SQL to query Rockbusterâ€™s PostgreSQL database and answer key business questions from various departments (sales, customer insights, and inventory). The final analysis was visualized in Tableau and presented in a slide deck for stakeholders.

Film titles, categories, and rental rates

Inventory and rental transaction data

Customer information (location, name, and contact)

Which movies generated the most and least revenue?

What is the average rental duration?

Which countries have the most Rockbuster customers?

Where are high lifetime value customers located?
